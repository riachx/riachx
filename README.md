## About Me

My name is Ria - I'm a third-year UC Santa Cruz **Computer Science B.S.** student + **programmer and 3D artist** (specializing in **Front-end** and **3D design**).

With about seven years of experience in **3D design** and around three years in **web development**, I've had the chance to intern as a web developer for Streetline Inc. and [**Tech4Good**](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/), intern as a **3D scripter** for [**CyArk**](https://www.cyark.org/), create websites like [**Spcwby.com**](https://spcwby.com/), and work as a **3D modeler** for a range of companies and startups, including [**Virbela**](https://www.virbela.com/) and [**Augmio**](https://www.augmio.com/). In addition to design, I have three years of experience with Python and C/C++.
